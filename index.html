												<h4>Week 1 - Welcome to web design!</h4>
												<p>In class, I was introduced to IXXN221 Web design and learnt about what the course is about, what I can be expected to learn and was briefly introduced to the assignments and class structure. We also had a mini icebreaker where we were paired up and had to create a name tag for each other. </p> 
													It was advised to download Visual Studio Code for the course so that was a new programme for me - I'm used to Atom but thought I'd stick to the class standard. I think it's important to learn new types of programmes anyways and this could be useful when you go into the workforce and there's an 'industry standard' programme and you know how to use it. Another thing I learnt was how a simple shortcut like '!' can bring up the code of a basic website! (Even though it didn't work for me but I still think it's cool to know). </p>
													Coding isn't new to me as I did Creative Coding I last year but I still don't feel confident enough in using it. I took this paper primarily for the design aspect but I also think it's so important to understand basic HTML and code so it makes it easier to work with engineers.. but also so you can make minor website changes if needed (if you're not using CMS or if the website requires you to go deep into the 'back end').
													Being able to build your own website from scratch is probably a big industry skill to have so knowing the basics is really important. We didn't really cover too much else in terms of technicals and applying it to design. </p>
													Learning the coding basics is really valuable, particularly in a technology driven world. I'm really looking forward to learning more about the ins and outs of web design, the importance of web design and how to create human-centred designs to improve human experience and interaction, how to solve their problems and I guess, how to get them to respond to your design and website in the way that we want them to.

												<h4>Week 2 - More HTML Basics + Understanding Users</h4>
												<p>This week, we learnt more HTML basics such as adding hyperlinks through text, images and a new HTML page for your website, how to make them open up in a new tab and how to create ordered and unordered lists. In class, we learnt about understanding our users and created user personas and empathy maps.</p>

													We were placed into groups of four where we were asked to create a user persona and empathy map for Spongebob Squarepants and his goal of wanting to start going to the gym. We presented our ideas in class and it was a really fun exercise.</p>
													
													I found it interesting learning about these traits and characteristics about Spongebob that I wouldn't have otherwise known about, such as, him not having a drivers licence so how would he get to the gym? I personally enjoy creating user personas and empathy maps because understanding a user and their needs is so interesting to me because everyone is different and motivated by different things/circumstances/emotions so I enjoyed exploring this more in the in-class activity. In terms of coding, I enjoyed learning more about the HTML basics and actually putting them into action in my blog. </p>

													I think as designers, it's so important to think about the end-user when it comes to designing or planning your product. After all, they are the ones that are going to be interacting with your website. You want to think about their goals and what they need/want out of going to your site because you want them to stick around and find what they're looking for as easily and seamlessly as possible. In terms of coding basics, I think it's a great starting point in learning how to start managing your data and flow of information. I've really enjoyed the coding aspect of web design - I'm still not sure whether or not I'll be building a website using CMS or code, but I think just having the fundamental basics down is really important. There's also a sense of satisfaction from being able to build something from scratch so seeing my blog, in all it's simple glory, coming to life makes me happy (as long as nothing goes wrong of course!) </p>

													Empathy is a huge soft skill to have as a designer. I think the more we learn about how to place ourselves into our users shoes in order to understand them, their goals and intentions, the better at our craft we will be. After all, what is the point of designing a product if it's not to be used by the user?</p>
											</div>

												<h4>Week 3 - CSS Box Models + Determining Goals</h4>
												<p>This week, we went through determining goals for your web product, so looking at things like types of user goals (life goals, experience goals, end goals), long-term goals, SMART goals etc. We also looked at how to define design goals to ensure they satisfy user requirements. We were put into a group of five and asked to create a Venn diagram using what we did for Spongebob last week. Our diagram needs to show design goals, user goals and the shared goals. I think the point of this exercise was so we could illustrate the relationship between the two and how we can satisfy both parts. </p>

													We also looked at measuring success so setting KPIs, conversions and SMART goals. We also spent some time completing a coding exercise where we created ordered and unordered lists using what we learnt from the pre-recorded lecture. I realise this is sort of repeated from last week's blog as well but for this week's pre-recorded lecture, we go through CSS and how to start beautifying our blog site. </p>
	
													I think it was interesting learning about using Venn diagrams to work out shared goals between design and user goals - it's really useful to know this because at the end of the day, we are designing for our users but we also want to ensure we're keeping within design standards i.e. accessibility. Coming from a comms and marketing background, I already understand the importance of measuring success but it was nice having a refresher. </p>
													
													Coding isn't new to me as I did Creative Coding I last year but I still don't feel confident enough in using it. I took this paper primarily for the design aspect but I also think it's so important to understand basic HTML and code so it makes it easier to work with engineers.. but also so you can make minor website changes if needed (if you're not using CMS or if the website requires you to go deep into the 'back end'). </p>

													I think once we start out in our careers as designers, particularly in interaction design, it's important to not only understand our users and empathise with them but to also track their activities so we can measure our own success and how our product is being received. It's almost like indirect feedback and feedback is so important - without it, how would we know what we need to do to improve and make the product better? </p>

													I think more than anything, it cements what I already believe - that feedback is important and setting goals is one way to get the feedback we need to improve our product and further understand our audience. A lot of work goes into creating a product and research is such a key component.</p>

											<h4>Week 4 - Flexbox + Planning User Journeys</h4>
											<p>In class, we went through planning user journeys and the different ways we do it - user flows and user journey maps. We went through why this was important in understanding our user personas and how it can help us make informed decisions with our product. </p>
												
												From the recorded lecture, I learnt all about CSS and box styles. </p>

												I’ve done user journeys and user flows before so it wasn’t really new but it’s always nice going through it all again as a reminder and to really drill how it works and its importance. I guess having more practice with user flows is always beneficial and exploring different ways of putting together user journey maps is good in the UX design practice. </p>
												
												Everything from the recorded lecture was new and interesting for me because I’d never done it before. I’m used to basic HTML or just updating an already existing template so it was fun playing around with CSS and box styles. </p>

												User flows are useful for web design because it helps you understand the current journey a user goes through when they’re trying to solve a particular problem. You can use it to then map out what you could do to improve the user’s experience. </p>
												
												From the information gathered through user flows, you create user journey maps to visualise the user’s thought process and emotions throughout the user flow. It can also help to really understand their pain points so we can find solutions to the problem. </p>

												It helps me as a designer because it’s a reminder that we’re designing the product for our users to help them meet their needs and their goals. I think it’s also very relevant when you’re trying to convince your team about the decisions you think are important so they understand your thinking and decision-making process as well. </p>
												
												At the end of the day, it’s about the user so having a user flow and user journey map really helps keep our focus on them and their needs. </p>
											 	
												Here's an image that I created of a draft user flow I was working on for my project. I wanted to play around with flex boxes as well. </p>

												<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/user-flow.png" width="250px" height="350px"></a>

												<p> Here are the end products:</p>

												<img src="images/journey-map.png" width="500" height="300">
														<p> The user journey map shows the different states of emotions that a user undergoes when using a product and it allows designers to work out pain points and use the opportunity to create solutions for a more positive user journey.</p>

											<h4>Week 5 - CSS Grids Part 1</h4>
											<p>During class, we had the opportunity to seek feedback on Project 1 and what we've done so far before hand-in. In terms of coding, we're learning different types of CSS Grids. For today, I thought I'd just test out the first template before trying out adding different rows. I think that the CSS grids would come in handy for Project 2 because it's teaching us how to structure our webpage and also ensure its responsive on other devices. </p>

												I think going from the last pre-recorded lecture to learning about CSS grids was a nice flow and was interesting for me. I enjoyed learning about how to create different grids and honing in on the basics of coding each week by doing these exercises. I like how I can just open Visual Studio Code and know what I need to do to set up a new page without having to refer to my notes or the video but it's also comforting having it all there to go back to if I'm in doubt or if I need a refresher or if for some reason something doesn't work. </p>
												
												In terms of class, it was good to get some feedback from Shiv on my project. Overall, it was positive and I'm interested to see how the presentation goes and what my final grade is for Project 1. </p>

												Having a structure to your website is very important in order to keep your audience engaged and for them to find things easily. Learning CSS grids is important to ensure that your website functions the way it needs to. I think when you start applying UX laws to your design, having the skills to form them through code is really beneficial. UX desing is important because the aim is to fulfill a user's needs. What we want to do as web designers is to provide a positive experience to keep our users loyal. We also want to create something that provides a meaningful experience. We can't achieve this without knowing how to properly structure a webpage. </p> 
												
												Something else I think is important with what we've learnt is accessibility and responsiveness. So ensuring your designs can be easily accessed on other devices without losing its functionality and flow is so important. If we want to create a positive user experience, then we need to ensure we're doing things to meet accessibility guidelines. </p>

												I think as the weeks go by in this course, it just really cements to me that our goal is to create something that put our customers and their experiences first. Having the knowledge to be able to code something that relates to UX laws is a valuable skill on top of understanding how to apply the UX laws to your design. </p>
												
												Also knowing how to ensure your website is responsive is another critical skill to have because there's no point in making something flow beautifully on one platform but then provides a completely negative experience for users on another. </p>

												<h4>Week 6 - Assignment 1 Progress</h4>
												<p> I think I've been tracking well with Project 1. Here's the work that I've submitted so far. </p>
												<p> With my design, I acknowledge that making a career change can be a stressful and mentally exhausting task for users, and requires them to make a lot of difficult decisions. By ensuring the experience is as simple and seamless as possible, it will make a huge difference to the user’s overall experience. If it weren't for doing this assignment, I don't think that we as designers would be able to </p>

											<h4>Week 7 - Colour theory and UX Laws</h4>
											<p>This week, we covered colour theory and UX laws, and their importance to web design. 

												I find that UX principles are really important in design because it’s more than just about the visual design. When designers understand user psychology, then it elevates a design and makes it work effectively whilst also looking great. How I understand it, UX principles are key in helping guide designers in thinking, creating and collaborating on their design. Employing the principles is what creates the most impact. 
												
												Like with all things, we have our favourites so I thought I’d cover a couple of my favourite UX laws that I tend to use in my designs.
												
												Jakob’s Law - this is where users spend time on other sites and apps so they prefer yours to work the same way as the others. I guess this is based on familiarity - we know most people find comfort in familiar and it’s somewhat scary using something new and unfamiliar so if it functions the way people expect it to then they’ll likely stick with it and find it a pleasant user journey.

												<p>	Goal-Gradient Effect - this is the idea that people are likely to complete their goal or speed up towards their goal l if they can see how close they are to it. This is because users are motivated by the end goal. It makes tedious tasks such as completing a form or waiting for a delivery much more positive because they can track it and see how close they are to doing it. I like including this element in my work because I think it’s important for users to see that a task isn’t as daunting or tedious as they think. </p>

												<p> Example of the Goal Gradient Effect in play for Job Switch.</p>

												<p> Colour theory is important for user interaction as well as accessibility. In terms of interaction, it relates to how the colours affect the user’s mind. Colour has the power to make users feel or act a certain way. For my design, I talk a lot about accessibility so with my colour usage, I want to make sure that the colours don’t clash and provide clarity rather than hurt the users eyes or cause confusion. </p>

												<p> For my project, I decided on the colours red and yellow and a secondary colour of blue. Red symbolises strength, power and desire which I thought were important emotions for the user especially with them wanting to do a career change. Yellow was selected because it represents happiness, confidence, warmth and positivity - all things that I felt users should feel when deciding to undergo a career change. I also wanted to incorporate different opacity of the primary colours so that the colour palette is varied, but without straying too far from the primary colours.

													<p> Here's a look at my colour design system for Job Switch. </p>

												<p> All in all, I think as designers it’s so important to consider the design psychology of user interaction when designing a product. After all, how can we expect our users to interact with a product the way we want them to, or to have a positive experience and keep using it or recommending it to others, if they’re not satisfied with how it functions?</p>

													<h4>Week 8 - Typography and CSS Grids 2</h4>
													<p> We looked at typography and its importance in web design. I think typography in web design is important because it establishes a strong visual hierarchy, provides a graphic balance to a website and provides good accessibility and ensures your website is readable. You wouldn’t think it but typographical layout helps guide users through a website. </p>

													<p>I think an important rule to follow (and what Shiv covers in the website) is to keep the font simple. If you choose funky fonts, it can be quite distracting for the user.
														
													<p> For my project, I chose to use Raleway as the display header and Poppins as the paragraph text. Raleway has an elegance to it, without being too serious. I wanted a font that was clean but also had an edge to it. I liked the overlapping lines in the letter ‘w’ and the subtle curves. For the paragraph font, I wanted a clear sans-serif font that was easy to read to aid in accessibility and that looked geometric and clean on screen. I felt Raleway and Poppins complemented each other and in terms of font hierarchy, it was easy for the viewer to distinguish between the two. </p>
														
													<p> When deciding on the appropriate weight, I tested how small the font would go before it stops being legible and decided that the lowest header should be 26px and lowest paragraph is 16px. </p>
														
													<p> With my design, I acknowledge that making a career change can be a stressful and mentally exhausting task for users, and requires them to make a lot of difficult decisions. By ensuring the experience is as simple and seamless as possible, it will make a huge difference to the user’s overall experience. If it weren't for doing this assignment, I don't think that we as designers would be able to </p>

											<p> For the pre-recorded lecture, we covered more CSS Grids but it was focused on accessibility and making sure your design functions on desktop, mobile and tablet smoothly. I thought it was interesting that the easiest way to do it is to start coding with mobile and then working your way up. I guess it makes sense because when working on Editor X, it was a massive pain having to ensure that your mobile grids aligned with your desktop grid. Grids on one platform aren't the same as the other because of the screen size and as a user, you don’t think about this at all because good design doesn’t require you to notice these differences. Being a designer/coder in training, I found myself starting to really think about the design differences and what I need to do to ensure the functionality works for all platforms, without making the user feel like they’re on a different website. Wireframing is such a helpful exercise when planning out the structure and design of your website for the different platforms.  </p>	
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Week 9 - Assignment 2-1 and EditorX Basics</h4>
												<p> For Project 2-1, I started out by hand-drawing my low-fi wireframes for both desktop and mobile. I then moved into Figma to put it all together and start thinking about things like accessibility, hierarchy and design. I also designed the branding for Job Switch. This part of the project is basically building the foundations before we move to code or CMS to build our design. </p>
												<p> Here is a snapshot of the work I did: </p>

												<img src="images/lowfi-wireframes.png" width="auto" height="auto">  
												<img src="images/hifi-desktop.png" width="auto" height="auto">
												<img src="images/hifi-mobile.png" width="auto" height="auto">
												
												<p> Reflecting on this project, I think I’ve done well in understanding the user and simplifying the website as much as possible to try and achieve the shared goals. I’m happy with some of the design decisions of how the website presents information. One thing that I feel I should’ve spent more time on is consistency of the images and gutter sizes in some of the pages. I feel like I should’ve added into the design system information on image sizes and box and gutter sizing. These are all details I think are quite important for a website to ensure consistency. I also feel like maybe I should’ve opted for a serif font for the headline/display type to make it really stand out, even though I really like using Raleway. If I had more time, I would’ve also liked to have added more interactive elements to the prototype and done more accessibility checks on the website. </p>
												<p> For my presentation, I felt unsure about my design decisions. The critiques and comments were fair and I completely appreciated them. But it just cemented some doubts that I already had with my hand-in, for example, with Shiv asking about my design decision on using a different colour for the buttons in the Events page and also not removing drop shadows in areas where there shouldn’t be drop shadows. I know there were some areas where I’ve accidentally included drop shadows to the entire elements but I was going cross eyed going through all of them and working out where I’ve added them and where I didn’t. Oh well, constructive feedback is always good feedback and we learn from them. </p>

												<p> For Project 2-2, I decided to go with the Design brief instead of the code brief because I’m not very confident with my coding abilities and given the timeframe, I was worried about being in a position where nothing was working or it didn’t look as good as I wanted it to. One of the programmes that we can use is EditorX and Shiv pre-recorded a couple of videos on the basics and how to use it. My first instinct was to either try coding with HTMLUp templates or use Webflow because I understand it’s an industry standard and what better time to acquaint myself with it than now. However, after trying it out for a couple of days and realising that I have so much I need to learn and digest, I decided I’d just go with EditorX. </p>
												<p> Following the pre-recorded videos, I found it fairly straightforward. It sort of reminds me of Silverstripe and Wordpress, which are two CMS programmes I’ve used in the past. I like how flexible it is though and how much freedom you have with your design. I enjoy learning new things and I think learning EditorX is one of the many new things I’ve been learning and enjoying in this course. </p>

													<h4>Week 10 - Working on EditorX</h4>
													<p> This week I started working on Project 2-2 with EditorX. It’s been a very interesting journey - while it’s easy enough to use, I find myself smacking my head against the wall a couple of times but through no one else’s fault but my own. facepalm </p>
													<p> One of the major changes I’ve had to make to my design when I started working on this project was having to reduce my font sizes. When I was working on Figma, the font sizes just seemed so small so I increased them but going into EditorX, they were far too large. H1 has gone from 42 to 28 and paragraphs have been reduced from 20 to 18. This will of course impact the font sizing on mobile - H1 is now 18 and paragraph is now 14. I also referred back to my Design System document and basically H1 has now changed to text sizes of H2 for mobile and H4 for desktop. To test the scaling of the text for accessibility, I zoomed out and made sure it was still readable. </p>
													<p> I also had to reconsider the sizing of my images, grids and containers. What I thought was going to be an almost easy input and go ended up being quite a large job where I spent so much time having to reconsider my design decisions. </p>
													<p> I also had some elements in my design that I struggled to make look right. For example, this divider bar thing that I designed: </p>
													
													<img src="images/aboutus-bar.png" width="500" height="25">  
													
													<p> I also initially wanted the testimonials to be a carousel that the user can click for more - the idea behind this was to give the user options for interaction. However, when recreating this in Editor X, I decided not to include it. Part of the reasoning is that I don’t have any more testimonials to add to make it function the way I want to, and I don’t think it really adds any value. This is the thing with prototyping in Figma vs actually creating in CMS - you end up making design decisions that are more practical and decide on the need to have vs the nice to haves. I appreciate this is going to affect the mobile version of my prototype so that the site becomes even longer to scroll but I think that should be fine. </p>

													<h4>Week 11 - Blog development + Assignment Progress</h4>
													<p> This week, we went through our blogs and how we’re tracking. I started off really well with working on my blog weekly but then when things got really busy at the six week mark with all my papers plus having my colitis flare ups, it dropped off a bit. However, I continued working on my written content, just not really on my design.  </p>
													<p> Here’s some pages on what my original blog looked like - I just spent time on playing around with what we were learning in the pre-recorded lectures: </p>
														
													<img src="images/og-blog-one.png" width="500" height="250"> 
													<img src="images/og-blog-two.png" width="800" height="500">
													<img src="images/og-blog-three.png" width="780" height="450"> 

														
													<p> I now need to spend some time planning what my final blog is going to look like, on top of working on Project 2-2. 
														Speaking of… here’s going to be the start of a rant. </p>
													<p> I’ve had to redo my website twice. The first time was because I was silly and didn’t use grids and when I realised I’d been doing it wrong, it made life so much easier having grids in place. I honestly don’t know what possessed me to not include the grids to begin with. It was a lot easier to build the design again with the help of grids so there’s that. The one thing that was annoying though was having to recreate the containers each time for the various events and blogs. </p>
													<p> The second time I’ve had to redo it was when I realised I hadn’t been checking on my mobile version and changing the grids to suit the platform. I’ve literally been in my own world focusing on just the desktop and trying to make it as perfect as I possibly can make it and this is the result of the mobile neglect. I think I genuinely thought that it would miraculously translate perfectly in mobile form. I spent about an hour or so trying to fix it and I tried resizing the font and then shifting images but it wasn’t a very easy fix. I came across section breaks which significantly impacted my desktop version. </p>

													<img src="images/resources-mobile.png" width="250" height="500">
													<p> The destruction that is my Resources page on mobile. </p>

													<p> Anyways, I was kindly granted a four-day extension to continue working on my assignment because balancing lots of deadlines and colitis is not fun. We got there in the end and I submitted my work to the best of my ability.  </p>
													<p> Let’s reflect though - doing this project made me realise I needed to make some design decision changes such as the colours of the CTA buttons - I made them all a consistent red. I also shifted the progress bar in the forms from the bottom to the top because that’s where it normally sits in other platforms (remember Jakob’s Law!). </p>
													<p> There were certainly some things I needed to do to make the website better. Unfortunately, the responsiveness of it isn’t perfect. If I had more time, I would’ve spent more time on responsiveness so it doesn’t go all over the show like it currently does if you change the size of the browser. When I used the sizing I had in Figma, it didn’t quite work the way I wanted it to. I think when working on Project 2-1, again I really didn’t pay too much attention to the sizes but rather on the look and feel and functionality of the website. This impacts the accessibility and usability significantly which is frustrating for me because it was such an important goal for the website. </p>
													<p> I do wish I had more time to do better work but I’ve done this to the best of my ability in the timeframe that I have and I do feel I’ve learnt a lot even if the website hasn’t come together as perfectly as I would’ve liked. I feel like if I had done it in code, I would’ve paid better attention to the sizing. But it’s done now and I’ve learnt a lot and know where my weaknesses are and whereI need to do better. I’m trying to ensure that my blog works better in terms of responsiveness to make up for how badly it turned out in Project 2-2. Here’s hoping! </p>

														<h4>Week 12 - THE END OF AN ERA</h4>
														<p> Well, not quite. I still have one year left of uni but it’s always a good idea to reflect on your courses at the end and think about what you’ve learnt, what could’ve been done better etc etc.  </p>
														<p> I feel like I’ve learnt A LOT from this course. The course content was exactly what I expected it to be but I do feel like towards the end of it, I’ve not done as well as I’d hope to. Juggling four papers and wanting to do well in all of them is a lot of work but I’m still proud of how much I’ve done and what I’ve accomplished. </p>
														<p> If I could go back, I’d definitely spend more time on responsive design. While I was super happy with the design of Job Switch, I think I would’ve taken a completely different approach to it. I created a lot of pages for it and I don’t know if that was normal? I realise maybe I should’ve focused on some pages and made sure I could do them well - sort of like quality over quantity. I think I would’ve designed it a bit differently as well and focused a lot more on the functionality rather than aesthetics. I wish I’d spent more time on accessibility as well because I talk about it a lot in my reports and how it was important for the design of the website. While I do believe the website is functional, it could’ve been a lot better. Colour scheme could be better as well, along with the display font choice. Raleway is beautiful but paired with Poppins, it seems almost similar? Maybe I’m being a bit too critical of the work I’ve done so far. </p>
														<p> What I enjoyed the most in this course was definitely the research and report side of things. Project 1 was really enjoyable and so was Project 2-1 but I think I stressed myself out with the latter because I was overthinking a lot of the elements. While I enjoyed Project 2-2 and Project 3, the technical side is a bit overloaded for me in the timeframe we have to complete the course. I’ve learnt so much about coding though and these are basic skills I can take into the workforce which I think is a big bonus. While I can’t really build beautiful websites from scratch, at least I understand the coding language and can make simple changes in the back-end.    </p>
														<p> In terms of my blog, I’m happy with how it’s turned out. While it’s quite simple, I did need to get some help with creating my sidebar and adding some of the features which I’ve gathered from the internet and from some javascript knowledge from creative coding. Looking at my HTML and CSS docs, my code looks absolutely chaotic and I hope it makes sense to the person looking at it. To me, it makes sense although my brain felt like it was about to explode when I was putting them all together. The pre-recorded lectures that Shiv did for us were super helpful and really helped with my learning. I also need to commend Shiv and the tutors for always being approachable and helpful throughout the journey. Constructive feedback is so important to me and to be able to get that to improve my work has been very helpful. I only hope that I’ve done the best that I can and that they can see how much I’ve learnt throughout this course. </p>
														<p> p.s. to whoever is grading this, I'm so sorry that my code is really messy! </p>
